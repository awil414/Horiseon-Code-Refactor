## Deployed Application

Client requested the code be refactored. I made changes to html to give the web page it's company name for the browser title, as well as refactored the header to navigate to a section that wasn't already doing so, by adding an id.
In css, I consolidated and deleted redundant lines that shared the same styling. I changed the styling to include padding: 4px.
